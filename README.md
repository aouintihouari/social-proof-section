## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for typography

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my ability to create responsive designs with flexbox and media queries. Here's an example of a media query used:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .hero {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
  }
}
```

### Continued Development

In the future, I aim to:

- Explore advanced CSS animations to enhance interactivity.
- Utilize CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Refactor the code for better scalability and readability.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Great for understanding HTML and CSS properties.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - A helpful resource for responsive design techniques.
